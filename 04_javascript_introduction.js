// declare a variable x and assign it a number. Print the number and the description in words

// declare a varibale y and assign it a string. Print the variable and a description of what it will be

// declare an array with your favourite animals. Use push and pop to remove and add some animals. Use shift and unshift to do the same.

// Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type.

// Array

// Show in code if: you can store multiple types in an array? 

//Find a way to make the next string more readable

let myString = "hello,this,is,a,difficult,to,read,sentence";

// Add meerkat to the next array between blowfish and capricorn

let favoriteAnimals = ['blowfish', 'capricorn', 'giraffe'];

// Functions

// Create a function that takes 3 arguments and returns the sum of the these arguments.

// Create a function named colorCar that receives a color, and prints out, 'a red car' for example.

// Create an object and a function that takes the object as a parameter and prints out all of its properties and values.

// Create a function named vehicleType that receives a color, and a code, 1 for car, 2 for motorbike. And prints 'a blue motorbike' for example when called as vehicleType("blue", 2)

// Make a list of vehicles, you can add "motorbike", "caravan", "bike", or more.

// Change the function vehicle to use the list of question 7. So that vehicle("green", 3, 1) prints "a green new bike".

// Use the list of vehicles to write an advertisement. So that it prints something like: "Amazing Joe's Garage, we service cars, motorbikes, caravans and bikes.". (Hint: use a for loop.)
// Hint, the output should be correct English with all the punctuation in place (that's the challenge). So plurals for the vehicle types, commas followed by a single space, the word and to replace the final comma and closed off by a period.

// What if you add one more vehicle to the list, can you have that added to the advertisement without changing the code for question 10?
