========================================================

**Atribute** a variable in an object
**Method** a function in an object

- **Composition** *has-a* relationship
- **Inheritance** *is-type-of* relationship
- **Delegation** atributes and methods are accesable by a child object

========================================================

- A class is defined before instances can be created.

**Prototype-based**

- No classes exists only objects.
- Objects link to exactly one other object.
