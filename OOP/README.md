Object-oriented programming
========================================================

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS

## Defenitions

**Atribute** a variable in an object
**Method** a function in an object

## Concepts

- **Encapsulation** each object keeps its state (variables/ attributes) inside a class together with some functionalities that are typical for this object
- **Abstraction** hiding unnecessary details from the user
- **Composition** *has-a* relationship
- **Inheritance** *is-type-of* relationship
- **Delegation** atributes and methods are accesable by a child object

Class-based vs prototype-based
========================================================

**Class-based**

- A class is defined before instances can be created.

**Prototype-based**

- No classes exists only objects.
- Objects link to exactly one other object.
- 

Inheritance vs delegation
========================================================
