Unit Tests

> Testing the smallest testable individual parts of the source code

There are many different frameworks and tools. A populair combination (which I used previously) is:

- **[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)** for running the tests
- **[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)** or the built in **[assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html)**
- **[Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)** for test spies, stubs and mocks
- **[Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/)** for calculating code coverage
