## DOM Manipulation

1. Use the example functions [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/DOM_manipulation.md)
1. Open the `apps.js` and start by declaring an array that contains 10 strings. These strings should be of book titles you have read (or made up) and be lowercase without spaces so that you can use these later as HTML id attributes. 
1. Create an `index.html` and add the required HTML to load the `app.js` file. 
1. Open `index.html` in the browser and confirm that the `console.log` statement shows the array. (Open the console in the inspector of your browser)
1. Remove the temporary `console.log` from the `app.js` file. Make a function (or functions) that generate a `ul` with `li` elements for each book ID in the array using a for loop.
1. Make an object (not an array!) containing information for each book. Each property of this object should be another (i.e., nested) object with the book ID you thought up in the first step as a `key`, and at least the following properties: `title`, `language` and `author`.
1. Write a function to take the actual information about the book from the object and display that.
1. Beautify your html page with css.
