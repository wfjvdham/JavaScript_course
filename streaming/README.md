> Protocol to communicate between a server and a client in both ways, *[full-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#FULL-DUPLEX)*, using a single TCP connection

- A permanent connection between the server and the client is created where the server can communicate to the client without waiting for a request from the client
